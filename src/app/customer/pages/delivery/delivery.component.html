    <h2>Carrier Direct</h2>
    <p>Take delivery from an independent carrier.</p>
    <p>This fee-based option is available for customers who prefer to have their car delivered, and who live more than 220 miles from the nearest Tesla delivery location. These deliveries are performed by independent carriers for a fee, based on your final
        delivery location. For faster delivery, we recommend taking delivery at a Tesla delivery location.</p>
    <p>Talk to your Tesla Advisor if you would like to add this delivery option to your order. Your delivery date will come directly from the carrier service. Tesla will provide a delivery date, which will be confirmed by the independent carrier once your
        car is in transit.</p>
